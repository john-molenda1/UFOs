# UFOs
-- John Molenda Module 11 Challenge Analysis

## Analysis Overview
We want to be able to identify and filter UFO sightings around the globe based on the date, city, state, country, and shape that was reported based on the sighting. Then, we want to give the user a description of the UFO sighting and the ability to search for additional sightings on the above criteria. 

## Results
In order to search the database, simply pick any combination of a date, city, state, country, and/or shape to see what sort of UFO sightings have been reported. The filtering menu will be on the left hand side of the screen and the search criteria will be white with a placeholder value as an example of what you could search and the format you should be searching in.

## Summary
### Drawback
One drawback of this webpage is you can't search by a range of dates, and are limited by a single day.

### Recommendations for Further Development
1) I would like the ability to provide a heatmap (simialr to the hotel challenge we completed earlier) of reported UFO sightings to see which areas are 'UFO Hotspots' as it were
2) I think it would be beneficial to link each UFO sighting to its own webpage so the user could click on one that they are interested in to provide a more detailed backstory of the events, who reported it, other possible explansations, and perhaps any other reports confirming the sighting.
